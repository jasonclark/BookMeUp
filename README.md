== Mobile Web Template with PHP and Javascript ==

Sample code and files for creating a mobile version of a web site.  
Utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript to work, but one could substitute any
server-side language for PHP.

These files are required:

index.php - the HTML to represent the web UI, contains some PHP
switch.php - the main logic, uses requests from index.php to load different HTML views
/meta/styles/m.css - the CSS to define the mobile interface style
/meta/scripts/global.js - the JavaScript used to provide the interface and UI effects
/views/*.html - HTML source files that switch.php uses to create views in app
/meta/img/* - image files for the web UI

--------------

NOTE: This mobile web template is a foundation that has been tested on multiple mobile devices.
It provides a jumping off point for mobile design, but you should feel free to customize to your 
specific needs by editing the CSS and other files that make up the UI.

DIRECTIONS: 
1. Download and unzip files.
2. Open the /views/ directory.
   - Each file in the /views/ directory represents a view that is displayed when a tab is clicked.
3. Edit the HTML files and add your web site info where needed.
4. Save files and upload to a public web directory.
