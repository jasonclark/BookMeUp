BookMeUp Template with PHP and Javascript
-----------------------------------------
Sample code and files for creating a BookMeUp recommendation tool as a web site. Utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript to work, but one could substitute any server-side language for PHP. To see this application running live, visit: https://www.lib.montana.edu/labs/bookme/

**These files are required:**
 - index.php - the HTML to represent the web UI, contains some PHP
 - switch.php - the main logic, uses requests from index.php to load different HTML views
 - /meta/styles/m.css - the CSS to define the mobile interface style 
 - /meta/scripts/global.js - the JavaScript used to provide the interface and UI effects 
 - /views/*.html - HTML source files that switch.php uses to create views in app 
 - /meta/img/* - image files for the web UI

----------

**DIRECTIONS**
 1. Download and unzip files.
 2.  Open the /views/ directory.
 3. Each file in the /views/ directory represents a view that is displayed when a tab is clicked.
 4. Edit the HTML files and add your web site info where needed.
 5. Save files and upload to a public web directory.

NOTE: This web template is a foundation that has been tested on multiple mobile devices. It provides a jumping off point for mobile design, but you should feel free to customize to your specific needs by editing the CSS and other files that make up the UI.
