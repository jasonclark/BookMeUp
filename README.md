== BookMeUp Template with PHP and Javascript ==

Sample code and files for creating a BookMeUp recommendation tool as a web site.  
Utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript to work, but one could substitute any
server-side language for PHP.

These files are required:

index.php - the HTML to represent the web UI, contains some PHP
switch.php - the main logic, uses requests from index.php to load different HTML views
/meta/styles/m.css - the CSS to define the mobile interface style
/meta/scripts/global.js - the JavaScript used to provide the interface and UI effects
/views/*.html - HTML source files that switch.php uses to create views in app
/meta/img/* - image files for the web UI

--------------

NOTE: This web template is a foundation that has been tested on multiple mobile devices.
It provides a jumping off point for mobile design, but you should feel free to customize to your 
specific needs by editing the CSS and other files that make up the UI. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at http://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/contact.php

DIRECTIONS: 
1. Download and unzip files.
2. Open the /views/ directory.
   - Each file in the /views/ directory represents a view that is displayed when a tab is clicked.
3. Edit the HTML files and add your web site info where needed.
4. Save files and upload to a public web directory.
